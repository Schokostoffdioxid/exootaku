#Eootaku (Working Title) Anime List App with React and jika

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Testing

This Project uses ESLint to find flaws in code-writing when using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
you might want to install the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) Extension. 

To edit some rules you can add them to the [.eslintr.js](.eslintrc.js) file.

for Testing Please make sure to use the Jest library which is part of `react-scripts` just type `npm test` to start the testing process. 

ATM I've implemented some Snapshot Tests for certain Components. Please feel free to add some on your own.
